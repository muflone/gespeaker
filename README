============================ INTRODUCTION =====================================

Gespeaker is a free GTK+ frontend for espeak.
It allows you to play a text in many languages with settings for voice, pitch,
volume and speed.
The text readed can also be recorded to WAV file for future listening.
Since version 0.6 it supports the speech synthesizer MBROLA for a better speech
experience.

============================ INSTALLATION =====================================

The following dependencies are needed to let Gespeaker work:
 - python2: all the whole code is written for Python 2.x
 - espeak: main speaking system
 - librsvg: needed for SVG loading
 - pygtk: needed for all the UI related code
 - python-dbus-common: needed by dbus interface
 - python2-xdg: needed to store configuration
 - alsa-utils: needed for aplay player

Optionall you can install the following to enhance the speech
 - mbrola: for enhanced mbrola voices support
 - mbrola-voices (like mbrola-it3, mbrola-en1 and so on)

The installation is pretty simple, just to execute from the sources directory:

python3 setup.py build
sudo python3 setup.py install

This will install all the required files in their places.
